## About Fusion Core UI
Fusion Core UI is a Laravel Blade & Tailwind CSS component library. It draws inspiration from
futuristic styles, clean and sleek. The goal is to allow this library to give your next app or project
a clean and bright feel grabbed straight out of a distant future!

## Requirements
* Must be using at least **Laravel 10**
* Must be using at least **PHP 8.1**
* Must be using **Tailwind CSS V3**

## Compatability
I want this library to be compatabile with other UI's you may rely on. Therefore, it comes with
an auto-prefix in order to display the components, `<x-fusion-core-ui-_____>`. This is explained in detail below.

## Roadmap 2024

The below elements will be in the initial version of Fusion Core UI with at least 1 or 2 variants.
Once these features are complete, it will signify version *1.0* of Fusion Core UI and will be considered
ready for production-level projects.

**Question:** Will you accept Pull Requests? 
- Yes, if you're interested in this project I'll be happy to utilize your contributions if they fit the intended vision.

**Question:** How long will you maintain this for?
- Indefinitely, and if I no longer see myself able to contribute I will hand it off to someone more capable.

**Question:** Will there be a standalone Tailwind or Laravel option?
- Not anytime soon. I like this idea, but it likely won't happen until version 2 or 3.

**Question:** Will there be more than 1 theme?
- I like the idea of having at least something for Dark / Light Modes. But Currently the focus is on building components that look best on darker backgrounds.

**Question:** What's up with the name?
- My very first domain and project was an online game called Fusion-Effect which existed from 2006-2008. This is a throwback that that name and project.

#### Why another UI Kit?
This is my first step into open-source, and it's somewhat of a personal challenge for myself,
in addition to a learning expirement. It's also my way of giving back to the Laravel and
Tailwind community, both have allowed me to pay my bills for many years.
